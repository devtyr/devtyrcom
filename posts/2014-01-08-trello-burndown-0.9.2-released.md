`trello-burndown 0.9.2` is available now. As Trello made it a bit difficult to get the needed `boardid` for `trello-burndown` it is possible to show a list of all boards for the current user now.

For that just call `node info.js` and you will get a list of your boards (name and board id).

You can download this version via [GitHub](https://github.com/devtyr/trello-burndown/releases/tag/v0.9.2 "trello-burndown 0.9.2 on GitHub") or as [NPM package](https://npmjs.org/package/trello-burndown "trello-burndown NPM package").
