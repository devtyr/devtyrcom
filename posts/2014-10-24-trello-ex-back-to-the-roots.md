`trello_ex` ([GitHub](https://github.com/devtyr/trello "trello_ex on GitHub") or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/package/trello_ex "trello_ex on npmjs.org")) was a fork of the `trello` NPM Package ([GitHub](https://github.com/GraemeF/trello) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/package/trello)). I decided to publish it as a standalone package as the original project wasn't maintained any more. Some time ago I got access to the original repository on GitHub as well as maintainer access on NPM. Therefore I decided to merge `trello_ex` back to `trello`. It ends up in the new version 0.3.0.

My project `trello-burndown` still uses `trello_ex`. There will be an update within the next day replacing the package.

You can download this version via [GitHub](https://github.com/GraemeF/trello/releases/tag/0.3.0 "trello 0.3.0 on GitHub") or as [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/trello "trello NPM package").
